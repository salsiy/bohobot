Welcome to the **Production-Grade Terraform Patterns** series.

In this 5-part guide, we walk through the journey of maturing your infrastructure from simple scripts to a robust, self-updating platform.

### What you will learn:
*   **Part 1**: How to structure repositories using the Split-Repo Pattern to isolate failure domains.
*   **Part 2**: How to write "Production-Ready" modules that are strictly versioned, validated, and tested.
*   **Part 3**: How to automate the entire release lifecycle (Changelogs, Tags) using Release Please.
*   **Part 4**: Why you should favor secure Git Tags over Private Registries for internal code.
*   **Part 5**: How to automate dependency upgrades across 100+ environments using Renovate.
